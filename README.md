<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;" >Human Activity Recognition</h1>

# 1. Business Problem 
## 1.1 Description 
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.
This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

## 2.1 Data
### 2.1.1 Data Overview
* Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings are taken from 30 volunteers(referred as subjects) while performing the following 6 Activities.

    1. Walking     
    2. WalkingUpstairs 
    3. WalkingDownstairs 
    4. Standing 
    5. Sitting 
    6. Lying.

* Readings are divided into a window of 2.56 seconds with 50% overlapping. 

* Accelerometer readings are divided into gravity acceleration and body acceleration readings,
  which has x,y and z components each.

* Gyroscope readings are the measure of angular velocities which has x,y and z components.

* Jerk signals are calculated for BodyAcceleration readings.

* Fourier Transforms are made on the above time readings to obtain frequency readings.

* Now, on all the base signal readings., mean, max, mad, sma, arcoefficient, engerybands,entropy etc., are calculated for each window.

* We get a feature vector of 561 features and these features are given in the dataset.

* Each window of readings is a datapoint of 561 features.

## 2.2 Mapping the real world problem to an ML problem
### 2.2.1 Type of Machine Leaning Problem
 - It is a multi class classification problem, given a new datapoint we have to predict the Activity.
